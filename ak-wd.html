                <h1>Case Study: Workday App</h1>
                <p>Making the app more user friendly.</p>
                <img src="images/workday.jpg" />
                <p>
                    For this project, we were to research an existing app or website that needed work/to be redesigned. For this project, I chose Workday. After conversing with friends who work with
                    Workday for their employment. They showed me the problems that they encountered and I redesigned these and their feedback throughout this project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this process, I discussed the app with people who use it reguarly to understand the issues that it had and the areas that could be improved. As I began to redesign each
                    section, I would do a small user test to make sure the design was userfriendly and appealing.
                </p>
                <p>Role: UX Designer</p>
                <p>School: Brigham Young University - Idaho</p>
                <p>Date Completed: March 2021</p>
                <h3>The Problem:</h3>
                <p>"The Workday app provides secure, mobile access to your Workday applications on-the-go." -App Store Desciption</p>
                <p>
                    The Workday app is an app designed to help workers and employers manage their time, clock in and out, see announcements from their place of work, request time off, and much more.
                    My goal is to fix several UX design problems to make the user experience stressfree and simple.
                </p>
                <h3>Areas to Work on:</h3>
                <img src="images/wd/Workday3.jpg" />
                <p>
                    My goal is to create logos that are more simple yet get the point across. and use the same icons throughout the app. I also want to put the different sections in a hierarchy of
                    importance while also limiting the space they take up.
                </p>
                <h3>Research:</h3>
                <img src="images/wd/Workday5.jpg" />
                <h3>Before:</h3>

                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday4.jpg" />
                <p>I researched other designs for each icon that I planned to recreate. Here are some of the results I found as well as some ideas I created for the new icons.</p>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday5 copy.jpg" />
                <h3>After:</h3>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday6.jpg" />
                <p>
                    In the final result, I redesigned the front page to make it look clean and organized. I redesgined some of the icons and created a hierarchy based on the importance and usage and
                    added a section to see the calendar.
                </p>
                <h3>Before:</h3>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday7.jpg" />
                <p>The calendar design was edited to make it more visually appealing and allow for information to be seen without have to select each day individually.</p>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday8.jpg" />
                <p>
                    To be able to redesign the calendar to be the most effective, I researched a bit about different calendar layouts and also asked people who use the Workday app about their
                    experience using the calendar feature. This helped me to create a more effective calendar layout and fit the needs of those using the app.
                </p>
                <h3>After:</h3>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday9.jpg" />
                <p>
                    For the calendar redesign, I decided to add events/work hours that can be easily read without selecting each individual day. It is now easier to see the schedule for the whole week
                    or month.
                </p>
                <h3>Before and After:</h3>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday10.jpg" />
                <p>
                    On the right is the before image, on the left is the redesign. For this page, I again talked with people who were currently using the app. There were quite a few issues that came
                    up and my plan for the page was to make it more useful. It should atomatically select the current day and allow the user to select to input their time worked on this page, as well
                    as reposition the submit button.
                </p>
                <p>I continued to use the same design from the calendar page and rearanged a few things such as the submit button and added a "Add Hours/Start Time" to the page as well.</p>
                <h3>Before:</h3>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday11.jpg" />
                <p>
                    I plan on making it easier to enter time, both for clocking in and clocking out. The main problem that I found when discussing this feature with other people was that it was
                    difficult to enter time and change the entered time and that it was confusing. My plan is to make it more user friendly.
                </p>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday12.jpg" />
                <p>Again I reseached other designs for clocks, ways to display time and for inputting time. Above are some ideas I found.</p>
                <h3>After:</h3>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday13.jpg" />
                <p>On this page, I continued to use the same calendar set up, and recreated the time inputsection. I made this page neater and more userfriendly becuase it is easier to navitage.</p>
                <h3>Before:</h3>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday14.jpg" />
                <p>
                    My goal for the "My Account" page of the app was to reorganize the sections by moving the "Organization ID" to the top so it is easy to locate, and make the whole layout clean and
                    neat.
                </p>
                <h3>After:</h3>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday14.2.jpg" />
                <p>
                    Here is the end result, it has a similar feel to the rest of the app with the colors and layout. It is meant to feel more organized with the sections ordered by heirarchy of
                    importance.
                </p>
                <img id="wd" src="images/wd/Workday15.jpg" />
                <p>Above are the main font styles and colors I used in the redesign.</p>
