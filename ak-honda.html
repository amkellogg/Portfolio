                        For this project, we were to research an area of interest that needed an app or website to help with an issue that is present. This issue was communication in a car dealership
                        between the Sales team and the Detail team. The solution was an app that would work for communication and organization.

                    <h3 class="uppercase font-sans text-xl lg:text-2xl pt-3 text-[#50295A]">The Problem and Idea:</h3>
                    <p>
                        I grew up around car dealerships a lot because that is where my dad worked. I would often hear about things that could be better around the shop, more recently, I heard of the
                        complications of communication between the Sales team and the Detail team. With the help of my dad and brother, we came up with this app idea to fix the problem that they saw.
                        The app will be designed for Car dealerships, to allow better communication between the Sales team and the Detail team. This will allow the two to communicate their ideas,
                        problems, and be able to plan out and keep in touch to keep the day going smoothly.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="uppercase font-sans text-xl lg:text-2xl pt-3 text-[#50295A]">Research:</h3>
                    <p>
                        From the research I conducted, there was not an app that covers the areas that I want to in this app that I want to develop. There are already messaging app such as Facebook
                        Messenger, Whatsapp, and Google numbers. However, I plan to create this app so it can be personalized to each dealership.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="uppercase font-sans text-xl lg:text-2xl pt-3 text-[#50295A]">Audience:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The main audience would be the employees of the car dealership. This app would allow the Salesmen and the Detail Team, or the shop workers to be able to work faster and more
                        effectively so that they can better meet the needs of their customers.

                    <p>
                        Here are the paper prototypes I will be using. In the image is scenario 2. I made this initial design on paper to be able to get all my thoughts down and to make an initial
                        design. I will make slight changes for round 2 before beginning the digital prototype design.

                        Here I provided an improved version of the paper prototype. After my first round of Usability Testing, I was able to learn where my design was confusing and how I could make it
                        better. Next will be to do another round of Usability Testings with this version of the paper prototypes and then start a digital prototype.

                        Here are the improved scenarios I have written to test the key features of this app. Through usability testing, I will be able to refine these scenarios and the design of the

                    <p>
                        Here I provided the first version of the digital prototype. After my first and second rounds of Usability Testing, I was able to learn where my design was confusing and how I
                        could make it better. Now I will be testing the digital prototype to see what else I can change and fix. This prototype is an example created on XD and does not function like a
                        real app - it just looks like it does.

                    <p>
                        Here is the second version of the digital prototype. Again, after each round of Usability Testing, I was able to learn where my design was complicated or badly designed and was
                        able to make it more user friendly. After doing a final round of usability testing, I came up with this design. This prototype is an example created on XD and does not function
                        like a real app - it just looks like it does.

                    <h3 class="uppercase font-sans text-xl lg:text-2xl pt-3 text-[#50295A]">What I Learned:</h3>
                    <p>
                        During the process of developing this app, I was able to better understand how to design an app to function in and for a work type environment. I had to do an ample amount of
                        research, both looking at other already created apps that function similarly to how I wanted my app to function, and also talk people in the industry that I was working to
                        design an app for. This helped a great deal because there were things that I looked passed. I learned more about design and how to create things so they would work well and be
                        user friendly.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="uppercase font-sans text-xl lg:text-2xl pt-3 text-[#50295A]">What I Would Change:</h3>
                    <p>
                        There were some parts of the design of the app that I wasn’t very satisfied with. While they worked in the technical sense, they could have been more visually appealing. Also,
                        while conducting the usability testing with the owner of a car dealership, also my father, he was pleased with the overall layout of the app, but also explained the other
                        needed aspects of the app if it were to be a real app. These weren’t things I could add in now, but they would be needed to help the dealership become more organized.
                    </p>

                        TheShop is an app inspired by the needs of the Car Dealership that my dad owns. Growing up my siblings and I would always spend a little time a week there and it became very
                        familiar. Recently, my brother worked with my dad and had a few ideas to better organize the shop. This included better communication between the employees

                    <p>The shop is designed to connect to the system that the dealership already uses, and helps with organization and communication even on your phone.</p>

                    <p>
                        TheShop went through three phases of Usability Testing, allowing me to see where I can improve the design to make it more easily managed. These Usability Tests were designed to
                        test key features of the app. It was reassuring to watch these tests as I saw where improvement was necessary and where the design was working.
