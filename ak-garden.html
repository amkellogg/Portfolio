                        or post unused garden space for others to enjoy. Allowing the community to
                        share and connect with common interests.

                        Another main part of this case study was to learn about Material Design and
                        use that in our designs. Using a Figma plugin, we were able to manipluate a
                        set of componants based on material design. This would help the outcome be
                        clean and more userfriendly.

                    <p>
                        Research is always important to understand what works in booking apps and
                        what doesn't. I also created several personas to get a feel of who would be
                        using the app and what their needs would be.

                        With these personas in mind, I made a list of what features should be
                        included in this app in order to meet their needs. This helps me to know
                        what to include in the app and how to organize the content. For this case
                        study, I will be designing six main screens, they will be listed below.

                        Task Flow & User Flow:

                    <p>
                        These diagrams and path descriptions are a vital way to understand the users
                        journey throughout the app. We start with the task flow which outlines what
                        the user will want to accomplish while using the app. Next we create the
                        user flow which will help us generate a route through the app to accomplish
                        the said task. By anticipating how a user will maneuver in the app, we can
                        predict any areas in the application where a user may get stuck or confused.

                        With these personas, features, task flow and user flow in mind, I begin
                        drawing sketches on paper to get the feel of how the app can be designed.
                        This will be the general outline and placement of the features. I will
                        continue to revise and improve the application’s interface. These are the
                        first sketches I created.

                        Taking what worked from my previous sketches, I created low fidelity wire
                        frames using Figma. These wire frames would be more accurate as to the
                        features I had set for the design, but it is still to see what works and
                        what needs to be changed.

                    <p>
                        Similar to the personas, user flow and task flow, a journey map helps to
                        further the design of the application and discover anywhere where there may
                        be difficulties while using the app. While creating the journey map, you
                        take one of the personas and walk through the process of using the
                        application as if you were them. Going through the phases and actions as if
                        you were in the mindset of the persona. You are trying to see what they
                        would think during each phase.

                        empathetic of the users. At the end you write down your insights. Below is

                        After creating the Journey Map, I can return to my wireframes to adjust or
                        makes changes as I saw nesessary during the Journey Map because of some
                        questions that arose. After creating the wireframe, I added more contant to
                        the page to complete it.

                        After some critique, I decided to add to it and change some things. The
                        feedback I got:

                    <p>
                        After this feedback I went back to make the changes to make the app more
                        userfriendly.

                    <p>
                        If I were to recreate this design, I would conduct more research on how it
                        would really work. With this knowledge, I would be able to create an even
                        better design that would be ready to be developed. I love how simple the
                        current interface is but I would want to add the small details that makes it
                        feel real.
